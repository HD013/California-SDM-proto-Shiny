## California-SDM-proto-Shiny

<br>

This is up and coming.
This is small project to make a shiny application that looks at the distribution of some California plant species. This trial run uses Abies concolor, White Fir, occurence data to look at where the species is likely to be found today, and where might be in the future.

Hailing back to some of my previous work ([see here](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/geb.13628)), I separated the occurences into accurate, infallibaly recorded records, and compared it to a category of those accureate records plus other records that have been verified, but not to as great a degree of precision (i.e. county-level). This more inclusive approach may yield some insights that would not have otherwise been realized.
